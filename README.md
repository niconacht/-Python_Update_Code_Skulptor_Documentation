# -Python_Update_Code_Skulptor_Documentation

From Project Description:
As part of upgrading CodeSkulptor from Python 2 to Python 3, the original CodeSkulptor Docs (for Python 2) needed to be updated to reflect the language differences between Python 2 and Python 3. The resulting CodeSkulptor3 Docs consist of more than 10,000 lines of HTML. (Note the actual HTML for the Docs was generated via program from a much better organized PHP file that was created by hand.)

The most extensive part of this update involved modifying the 600+ code examples using *Print* to reflect the fact that print is a function in Python 3. 
Making this update by hand would have been both time consuming and error prone. 
In practice project, you will write a script in Python 3 that automatically updates the HTML for the CodeSkulptor Docs 
such that almost all of the examples use correct Python 3 syntax for *Print()* (i.e. the arguments are enclosed in parentheses).
